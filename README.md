# My own kernel!

This is a kernel written in C and x86 assembly which then transforms into x86_64 during compilation. It basically just prints some text and then does not much more.

Roadmap:
✅ Bootloader using grub
✅ Easy compiling command utilizing Docker for universal support
✅ Text output
❌ Keyboard input
❌ Terminal commands
