# My own kernel!

This is a kernel written in C and x86 assembly which then transforms into x86_64 during compilation. It basically just prints some text and then does not much more.

Roadmap: </br>
✅ Bootloader from scratch. </br>
✅ Easy compiling command utilizing Docker for universal support </br>
✅ Text output </br>
❌ Keyboard input </br>
❌ Terminal commands
